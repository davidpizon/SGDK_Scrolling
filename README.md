# SGDK_Scrolling
This contains a couple of simple scrolling examples using [SGDK](https://github.com/Stephane-D/SGDK) [1.60](https://github.com/Stephane-D/SGDK/releases/tag/v1.60).  You will need to have SGDK 1.60 setup on your system to use this code.  It requires the new MAP code and won't work with older versions of SGDK
